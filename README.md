# TODO
 - Update API to be more consistent with Director syntax ( using new keyword )
 - Implement as Flatiron plugin and integrate with `flatiron/scaffolding` branch
 - Figure out Director.mount API so we can add `restful` dispatching as a mounted routing map instead of nested router.dispatches
 - Implement better view system ( maybe `viewful` )
 - Implemented and document browser support
 - Full property type support ( numeric, boolean, array, object )
 - Nested schema properties
 - Twitter Bootstrap integration / styling
 - Test improvements ( more tests / add helpers )
